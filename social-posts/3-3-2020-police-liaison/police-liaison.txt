Police Liaison Training TODAY at 4:30pm in The Temple of Zeus.

At actions with a police presence, we have a designated person to interact with cops. Come to today's workshop to learn all of the skills necessary to act as a police liaison, chat about why we use a police liaison and how we should be interacting with cops, and get some practice. See ya there!
