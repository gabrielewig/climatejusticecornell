Stand up to Violence Against Indigenous Women: Cornell Divest Now!

Join us Friday 3/6 at 12:20pm on the Ag Quad for a CJC x NAISAC demonstration highlighting Cornell's complicity in the climate crisis as it perpetuates trauma of murdered and missing indigenous women.

An art build for the event will occur on Thursday 3/5 at 8:00pm at Akwe:kon.
